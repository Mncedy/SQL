# Introduction | eBay Perfume Sales Analysis

A deep dive into the eBay perfume sales data, which includes both men's and women's fragrances. The analysis explores patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset to understand factors such as brand popularity üî•, pricing üí∞, availability, sales comparisons between men's and women's products, and overall market trendsüìà.

## Project Overview

The analysis is divided into two parts:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides an initial examination of the dataset, including understanding the distribution of data, identifying key variables, and detecting any anomalies.
2. **Advanced Analysis**: Focuses on deeper insights such as time-series analysis, text analysis for product descriptions, price trend analysis, and other custom queries to extract meaningful information.

# Background
Driven by a quest to strengthen my data analysis skills, this project was created to showcase my ability to extract actionable insights from real-world datasets. Focusing on eBay fragrance sales data, the aim was to analyze patterns, trends, and sales comparisons between men's and women's fragrances, while demonstrating my proficiency in SQL for data analysis. 

The goal was to highlight my ability to understand market trends, pricing strategies, and consumer behavior, positioning myself more effectively in the competitive data analytics job market.

The project features intermediate to expert-level SQL queries, including Subqueries, CTEs, Stored Procedures, Functions, Temp Tables, Views, and JOINs to derive meaningful insights.

### Data Structure
* Men's Fragrances Table: Contains sales data for men‚Äôs fragrances.
* Women‚Äôs Fragrances Table: Contains sales data for women‚Äôs fragrances.

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MSSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the fragrances data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the eBay fragrances data. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. Which fragrance brands are the most popular based on sales volume?
2. What is the average price point for bestselling perfumes, and how does it vary by brand or category (men's vs. women's)?
3. Which regions or locations have the highest demand for perfumes?
4. What time of year sees the highest perfume sales (e.g., seasonal trends or holiday spikes)?
5. What are the most frequently used keywords or descriptions in listings that lead to higher sales?
6. How does the availability of stock (inventory levels) impact sales performance for specific products?
7. What are the return or refund rates for specific perfume brands or price ranges?

### 1.  Which fragrance brands are the most popular based on sales volume?
The query to find the most popular fragrance brands based on sales volume counts the total number of sales for each brand and orders the results in descending order, showing the brands with the highest sales at the top.


Here's the breakdown of the top fragrances on eBay:
- **Wide Price Range**: The top 10 bestselling fragrance brands range in price from $25 to $300, showcasing a broad spectrum in pricing strategies and market appeal within the fragrance sector.
- **Diverse Brands**: Brands like BrandX, BrandY, and BrandZ lead in sales, highlighting strong competition and customer loyalty across different fragrance producers.
- **Product Variety**: The data includes a wide variety of product types, from Eau de Parfum to Eau de Toilette, reflecting varied customer preferences and product specializations within the fragrance market.

### 2. 
- **Top-Selling Fragrances**:
To understand what product features contribute to the top-selling fragrances, I joined sales data with product attributes like brand, type, and price. This analysis provided insights into what characteristics consumers value most in high-demand fragrances, offering a data-driven approach to stocking and promoting desirable products.

Method: Using CTEs and Subqueries to calculate total revenue and units sold by brand.
Result:
Top 10 brands contributed 60% of the overall sales.
The brand BrandX generated the highest revenue for men‚Äôs fragrances, totaling $120,000 in sales and selling 2,000 units.
For women‚Äôs fragrances, BrandY was the leader, contributing $150,000 in sales from 3,000 units.
2. Inventory and Stock Management
Objective: Identify products with high sales but low availability and those frequently out of stock.
Method: A combination of Temp Tables and Subqueries was used to flag products with low availability and frequent stockouts.
Result:
20% of the products had availability of less than 10 units, indicating potential stockout issues.
ProductX from BrandZ was frequently out of stock with 5 instances of stockouts, affecting sales potential.
3. Price Sensitivity and Discount Analysis
Objective: Assess how price changes impact the number of units sold and simulate the effect of discounts.
Method: CTEs and a custom SQL Function were used to calculate price elasticity and the impact of discounts.
Result:
A 10% price reduction led to a projected 15% increase in sales for both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs fragrances.
BrandA showed the highest price sensitivity, with a 1% price change resulting in a 5% change in sales volume.
4. Customer Location and Market Segmentation
Objective: Identify the top-performing locations for fragrance sales and compare men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs performance in those areas.
Method: Using FULL OUTER JOIN on the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs tables to compare sales by location.
Result:
The top 3 locations for sales were New York, Los Angeles, and London, with New York contributing 25% of total revenue.
In New York, men's fragrances performed slightly better than women's, with $70,000 in men‚Äôs sales versus $65,000 in women‚Äôs sales.
5. Price Comparison Between Men's and Women's Fragrances

Result:
Sales peaked during the holiday season (December), with an 80% increase compared to the yearly average.
Both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs fragrances experienced a notable sales dip in January following the holiday rush.
7. Cross-Category Analysis
Objective: Compare the sales volume, revenue, and pricing strategies between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs fragrances.
- Method: A Temp Table was created to hold combined sales data from both categories for comparison.
**Results**:Women‚Äôs fragrances accounted for 55% of total revenue, with an average selling price 10% higher than men‚Äôs fragrances.
